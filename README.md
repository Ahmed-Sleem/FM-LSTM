## Overview
FM-LSTM is a PyTorch implementation of a **hierarchical recurrent architecture** inspired by fractal memory.  
It splits LSTM cell memory into multiple levels, enabling **multi-scale temporal learning** with fewer parameters.  

- Parameter-efficient (40â€“50% fewer params than LSTM in our tests)  
- Designed for **long-term temporal dependencies**  
- Tested on Weather, Air Quality, Sleep, and SST datasets  

ðŸ‘‰ See the **[paper](link-to-paper)** for full theory, experiments, and analysis.
